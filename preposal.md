# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Webpage Scavenger Hunt: The user requests a hunt, and the website hides an item somewhere in the website, and the user has to find it.
Subway Surfer: That game genre
Tetris Spin-off: The blocks now "fall" from the top, left, right, and bottom towards a square in the center,
    and your goal is to make a complete square layer to remove blocks and survive as long as possible. You can rotate the center also.
Other Retro-Game Spin-offs: Graphics are simple enough to produce, and the simple game serves as a great starting point.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
